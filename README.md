# nagini
A set of Python scripts for processing quantitative PET data.

Currently there are the following scripts:
	cbfIdaifOhta.py - Fits a three-parameter flow model to PET data using an image-derived input function.
	cbfIdaif.py - Fits a two-parameter flow model to PET data using an image-derived input function.
	cbvIdaif.py - Creates quantiative CBV images using an image-derived input function.
	gluIdaif.py - Fits a three-paramter FDG model to estimate the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose using an image-derived input function.
	nagini.py - Module with various image processing functions.
	oxyIdaifOhta.py - Fits a three-parameter oxygen metabolism model to PET data using an image-derived input function.
